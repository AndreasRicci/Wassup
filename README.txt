NOTES

- This was a project for CS349 User Interfaces at the University of Waterloo.
- It is best viewed in Google Chrome on a laptop or desktop, but is also responsive for mobile devices.
- It was created on a strict (and short) timeline, so there are many improvements which could be made.
- Many libraries and other tools were disallowed, so some grunt work is evident.

- See "Project Specifications" for more information about this project.
